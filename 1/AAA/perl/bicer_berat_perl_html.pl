# Demonstrates different scoping mechanisms in Perl

# The subroutine &ReadParse" (from the external utility program cgi-lib.pl) gets the data that was just submitted and makes it available to you.  For instance  $in{first_name}  has the first name.
CGI::ReadParse();
 
# The subroutine  "&PrintHeader"  (also from cgi-lib.pl)  is essential to print output to the user's screen.
